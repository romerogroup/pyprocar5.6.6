Contributing
==================================

We absolutely welcome contributions and we hope that this guide will
facilitate an understanding of the PyProcar code repository. It is
important to note that the PyProcar software package is maintained on a
volunteer basis and thus we need to foster a community that can support
user questions and develop new features to make this software a useful
tool for all users.

This page is dedicated to outline where you should start with your
question, concern, feature request, or desire to contribute.

Being Respectful
-----------------------------------

Please demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people, other software,
and the communities who have worked diligently to build (un-)related tools.

Please do not talk down in Pull Requests, Issues, or otherwise in a way that
portrays other people or their works in a negative light.
